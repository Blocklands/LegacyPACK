#Legacy of the Survivors

Modpack for the game Minecraft (1.7.10) using forge (10.13.4.1448+)

A world with technological progression mixed with limited magic where individual "lone wolf" survival is discourage. World Generation is influenced from TerraFirmaCraft, one node can be mined for a while but each node will be some distance from the next. Technology will require though, steam power can cause explosions if not properly built. RF based batteries have been disabled; this will increase fuel use and cause "loss" of potential power. Electrical systems will require thought on distribution pattern, and method of generation.
