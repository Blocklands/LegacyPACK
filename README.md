#Legacy of the Survivors

Modpack for the game Minecraft (1.7.10) using forge (10.13.4.1448+)

Begin your journey into a world of technology that has been corrupted by magic where "lone wolf" survival is not the best option.  Sail the oceans and rivers (SHIPS MOD), trade with other players, create a faction and claim territory (Territorial Dealsing), Construct Mines (Custom Ore Generation), and Avoid colapsing blocks (~~BlockPhysics~~).

Survival will be more difficult than your vanilla experiance!
